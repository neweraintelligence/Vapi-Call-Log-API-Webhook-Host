Based on the Make.com scenario images you've shared, I can extract and describe the complete workflow for you. This appears to be an automated cold calling system for tire shops that integrates with VAPI (Voice AI Platform).
Complete Make.com Scenario Description
Workflow Overview
This is a 5-step automated workflow that processes tire shop data from Google Sheets, makes phone calls via VAPI, and updates the results back to the spreadsheet.
Step-by-Step Workflow Breakdown
Step 1: Google Sheets - Search Rows
Purpose: Retrieves tire shop data from a spreadsheet
Configuration:
Connection: "My Google connection (si...)"
Spreadsheet: "Cold Caller - Tire Shops"
Sheet: "Sheet1"
Filter: Only rows where status (D) equals "QUEUED"
Limit: 5 results maximum
Columns: A-ZZZ range
Headers: Yes
Sort: Ascending order
Step 2: Iterator
Purpose: Processes each tire shop record individually
Configuration:
Takes the array of results from Step 1
Iterates through each row containing: name (A), number (B), attempt (C), status (D), next_call (E), notes (F), Row number
Step 3: HTTP - Make a Request
Purpose: Initiates phone calls via VAPI API
Configuration:
URL: https://api.vapi.ai/call/phone
Method: POST
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer e5fe0341-cdd5-404a-be53-27281b79bb5d
Content-Type: application/json
Body (JSON):

    {
      "phoneNumberId": "378d0642-42d2-4d56-8c65-193492d77201",
      "assistantId": "842bd6e8-0750-4d4f-a169-b62b53578c0d",
      "customer": {
        "number": "1. number (B)"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "row": "1. Row number",
        "attempt": "1. attempt (C)"
      }
    }


Apply to VAPI_CONFIGU...
Error handling: Evaluates all states as errors except 2xx and 3xx
Step 4: Tools - Sleep
Purpose: Adds delay between calls
Configuration:
Delay: 1 second
Range: 1-300 seconds allowed
Step 5: Google Sheets - Update a Row
Purpose: Updates the spreadsheet with call results
Configuration:
Connection: Same Google connection
Spreadsheet: "Cold Caller - Tire Shops"
Sheet: "Sheet1"
Row number: 1. Row number (dynamic from iterator)
Headers: Yes
Values to update:
name (A): 1. name (A)
number (B): 1. number (B)
attempt (C): add(2. attempt (C), 1) (increments attempt counter)
status (D): "RANG" (hardcoded)
next_call (E): (empty)
notes (F): (empty)
Data Flow Summary
Extract: Pulls up to 5 "QUEUED" tire shop records from Google Sheets
Process: For each record, makes a phone call using VAPI with the shop's phone number
Delay: Waits 1 second between calls
Update: Marks each processed record as "RANG" and increments the attempt counter
Key Technical Details
VAPI Integration: Uses specific phone number ID and assistant ID for automated calling
Error Handling: HTTP module configured to treat non-2xx/3xx responses as errors
Rate Limiting: 1-second delay between calls to avoid overwhelming the system
Data Tracking: Maintains attempt counters and status updates for each record
Batch Processing: Limited to 5 records per execution cycle
This workflow essentially automates cold calling for tire shops by reading from a queue, making calls, and updating the status of each attempt in the spreadsheet.
