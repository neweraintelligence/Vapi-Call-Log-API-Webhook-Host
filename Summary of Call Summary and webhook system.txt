VAPI Call Summary Project
   Project Overview
This is a Central Call-Log System for OK Tire that captures and processes voice agent call data from VAPI (Voice AI Platform). The system acts as a bridge between VAPI's AI voice agents and Google Sheets, providing real-time call logging with structured data analysis.
🏗️ Architecture & Purpose
Core Functionality
Webhook Endpoint: Receives call data from VAPI voice agents
Multi-Agent Support: Automatically routes calls to separate Google Sheets based on agent ID
Data Processing: Parses JSON payloads and extracts structured customer information
Google Sheets Integration: Writes processed data to organized spreadsheets
Operational Intelligence: Provides follow-up tracking and escalation detection
Key Features
✅ Real-time call ingestion from VAPI webhooks
✅ Multi-agent routing to separate sheets
✅ Structured data parsing with validation
✅ Phone number redundancy (captures from both AI analysis and call metadata)
✅ Google Sheets integration with retry logic
✅ Operational views for follow-ups and reporting
✅ Future CRM extensibility with dual-write capability
📊 Data Schema
The system captures and processes 15 key data fields:
Category	Fields
Identifiers	timestamp, vapi_call_id
Customer Data	Name, Email, PhoneNumber (with validation)
Call Context	CallerIntent, VehicleMake, VehicleModel, VehicleKM
Operational	escalation_status, follow_up_due, call_duration, call_status
Summary	CallSummary, raw_payload (for debugging)
